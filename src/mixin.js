/**
 * `<catalyst-lazy-properties-mixin>` is a mix in funcation that retruns a class that extends the given super class.
 * The returned class will be the same as the super class except it will also have support for lazy properties.
 *
 * A user may set a property on an _instance_ of an element before its prototype has been connected to its class.
 * This mix provides the `upgradeProperty` method which will check for any instance properties and run them through
 * the proper class setters.
 *
 * See the [lazy properties](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices#lazy-properties)
 * section for more details.
